# SentimentClassification

A binary classification model for determining the sentiment of some text.

Training data must be plain text and labelled.

Training data must be formatted \<classification\> \<review\> where \<classification\> takes on vales "+1" and "-1" only for positive and negative sentiment respectively, and the review must be UTF-8 encoded where each review is written on a single line (the same line as the classification).

Model requires distinct training set and validation set.
